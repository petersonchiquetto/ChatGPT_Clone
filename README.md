# ChatGPT_Clone

ChatGPT_Clone is a project inspired by the repository [open-webui/open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui). It aims to provide an interactive application based on artificial intelligence, featuring advanced natural language processing and analysis capabilities.

## 🌐 Application Architecture

The application architecture follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern to ensure clear separation of responsibilities and ease of maintenance. The application consists of:

- **Backend:**
  - 💾 Implemented in Python using the Flask framework for building REST APIs.
  - 🔧 Data management handled with SQLAlchemy for relational database integration.
  - 🔹 Integration with external APIs for additional data collection (if needed).

- **Frontend:**
  - 🔤 Built with React to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
  - 🔄 State management using Redux.

- **Database:**
  - 🔑 Relational database (PostgreSQL) for persistent information storage.
  - 🎮 Caching support using Redis to improve the performance of frequent queries.

- **Infrastructure:**
  - 🛠️ Docker containers to standardize the development and production environments.
  - 🌐 Scalability support with Kubernetes (optional).

## 💡 Features

- **🧐 AI Interaction:** Interface for dynamic and contextual interactions with AI models.
- **🎯 Model Customization:** Support for training and fine-tuning pre-existing models with custom data.
- **🔄 Interactive Dashboard:** Real-time visualization of metrics and reports.
- **🔒 User Management:** Authentication system and permission-based access control.
